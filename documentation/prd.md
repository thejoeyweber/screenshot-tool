# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **TL;DR**  
We are building a web application for pharmaceutical marketers and agencies to streamline capturing, organizing, and compiling website screenshots into logically structured PDFs for Medical Legal and Regulatory (MLR) reviews. The tool automates cumbersome manual processes, offers robust customization, and integrates advanced features to cater to industry-specific needs.

---

## **Problem Statement**  
Pharmaceutical marketers currently spend 10–15 hours per website project manually capturing and organizing screenshots for MLR reviews, often leading to missed content and errors. These inefficiencies cost agencies and internal teams thousands of dollars in productivity losses per project, while adding frustration to a critical compliance task. Our tool automates the process, eliminating common bottlenecks and delivering an accurate, professional-grade output in a fraction of the time.

## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **Homepage:**  
   - User lands on a clean, intuitive dashboard. Options: "Start New Project" or "Load Existing Project."  

2. **URL Input & Sitemap Extraction:**  
   - User enters a website URL.  
   - The application automatically extracts the sitemap and presents URLs in a hierarchical list.  

3. **Page Selection:**  
   - Users select pages for screenshots using checkboxes or filters.  

4. **Configuration Options:**  
   - Global, section, or page-level settings for screen size, screenshot type, delays, and element hiding.  

5. **Screenshot Generation:**  
   - Users initiate screenshot capture. Progress bar or status updates displayed in real time.  

6. **Error Handling:**  
   - If the sitemap cannot be extracted:  
     1. Notify the user and provide alternative options:
        - Allow manual URL entry.
        - Suggest troubleshooting tips (e.g., verifying public access).  
     2. Log errors for backend review to improve the product over time.  

7. **PDF Customization:**  
   - Users add a templated cover page with their branding.  
   - Reorganize pages via drag-and-drop.  
   - Review metadata summaries (e.g., alt tags, page titles).  

8. **Final Download:**  
   - Download compiled PDF or individual screenshots in JPEG format.

## **Narrative**  
Imagine Emily, a digital marketer at a pharmaceutical company, tasked with preparing an MLR submission for a newly launched product website. Traditionally, this would mean navigating the site manually, taking screenshots, organizing them in Word, and ensuring all content is captured accurately—a process consuming days of effort.  

With our tool, Emily enters the website URL, selects pages from the sitemap, configures settings for screen sizes and delays, and generates full-page screenshots in minutes. The screenshots are compiled into a professional PDF with a templated cover page, logical organization, and a metadata summary. Emily can search indexed page content to verify accuracy and quickly recapture any missed pages. The result? Emily submits her MLR packet in hours, not days, and with far greater confidence in its completeness and professionalism.

## **Technical Considerations**
- **Authentication Handling**: Securely manage user credentials for staging and private sites.  
- **Scalability**: Build modular systems for future feature additions like cross-website search.  
- **Error Handling**: Include fallback mechanisms for inaccessible pages (e.g., manual screenshot uploads).  
- **Content Indexing**: Implement robust indexing to support fast search functionality across large datasets.

## **Risks and Mitigation**
1. **Risk**: Sites with overly complex dynamic content might not render well in screenshots.  
   **Mitigation**: Allow users to manually upload screenshots.  

2. **Risk**: Users might face issues understanding advanced features.  
   **Mitigation**: Include in-app tooltips and a knowledge base.  

3. **Risk**: Sitemap extraction might fail for certain URLs.  
   **Mitigation**: Offer manual URL entry and troubleshooting tips.
