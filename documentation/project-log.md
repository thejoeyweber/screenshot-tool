## January 13-14, 2024

### Storage Strategy Planning
- Analyzed storage requirements for screenshot pipeline
- Designed three-phase storage approach:
  1. Temporary (MVP): Local filesystem with 24h retention
  2. Intermediate: Hybrid local-cloud with 7-day retention
  3. Archive: Long-term cloud storage with 30-day retention

### Performance Analysis
- Evaluated storage options:
  - Local filesystem: Best write performance (~500MB/s)
  - Object storage: Better scalability but higher latency
  - Hybrid approach: Balance of performance and reliability

### Implementation Strategy
- Defined MVP storage structure:
  - `/tmp/screenshots/{session_id}/{timestamp}-{url-hash}.jpg`
  - Session-based organization
  - Automatic cleanup system
  - Error handling and recovery

### Technical Decisions
- Chose local filesystem for MVP phase
  - Fastest implementation path
  - Best initial performance
  - Simple cleanup process
  - Easy migration path to cloud

### Future Considerations
- Prepared for cloud integration
  - S3/R2 storage integration
  - CDN implementation
  - Compression strategies
  - Long-term archival

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement local storage system
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Create cleanup routines
- [ ] Add disk space monitoring
- [ ] Implement error recovery
- [ ] Prepare cloud storage integration plan
