## Next Steps

### 1. Quality Assurance
```typescript
interface QAChecklist {
  performance: {
    largeJobHandling: boolean
    memoryUsage: boolean
    diskUsage: boolean
    cleanupEfficiency: boolean
  }
  reliability: {
    errorRecovery: boolean
    sessionPersistence: boolean
    concurrentUsers: boolean
    edgeCases: boolean
  }
  security: {
    inputValidation: boolean
    sessionIsolation: boolean
    resourceLimits: boolean
  }
}
```

### 2. Error Recovery Improvements
```typescript
interface ErrorRecovery {
  retryStrategy: 'immediate' | 'backoff' | 'manual'
  maxRetries: number
  backoffInterval: number
  onRetry: (error: Error, attempt: number) => Promise<void>
  cleanup: () => Promise<void>
}
```

### 3. Session Management
```typescript
interface SessionManagement {
  cleanup: {
    frequency: number
    maxAge: number
    strategy: 'immediate' | 'scheduled'
  }
  monitoring: {
    activeSessions: number
    diskUsage: number
    lastCleanup: Date
  }
}
```

## Testing Criteria
- Complete flow from URL input to download works ✓
- Session state persists between routes ✓
- Batch processing handles large jobs ✓
- Resource usage stays within limits ✓
- Errors are properly handled and reported ✓
- PDF exports maintain image quality ✓
- ZIP exports include all necessary files ✓

## Future Enhancements
1. Custom PDF templates
2. Advanced image processing options
3. Batch job scheduling
4. API documentation
5. User preferences storage
